## Troubleshooting

### I'm getting a React error when using local package link `yarn link emukit`

If your're facing a duplicated React instance error when using `yarn link` you may need to create an alias to the Emulator's react package.

Try adding the following code to your project's `package.json` file:

```json
"alias": {
    "react": "<your-emukit-relative-path>/node_modules/react",
    "react-dom": "<your-emukit-relative-path>/node_modules/react-dom"
}
```

In some operative systems (ex: Mac OS) absolute oath prefixes should be avoided and relative paths should be used instead.

‚ö†Ô∏è The following message may appear in you browser's console when this error occurs:

```text
Warning: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:
1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)
2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app
See https://reactjs.org/link/invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and fix this problem.
